# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results
*In the retiring_titles table we notice that there are around 60,000 people retiring from senior level positions alone
*Also in the retiring_titles table there seem to be only 2 managers retiring which I find quite strange.

*In the mentorship_eligibility table, there seems to be 1549 eligible mentors that meet our requirements of age and employment status.
*Finally, in the unique_titles table, we were able to get the titles of the employees based on their first occurrence of employee number.
