# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results
*In the retiring_titles table we notice that there are around 60,000 people retiring from senior level positions alone
*Also in the retiring_titles table there seem to be only 2 managers retiring which I find quite strange.

*In the mentorship_eligibility table, there seems to be 1549 eligible mentors that meet our requirements of age and employment status.
*Finally, in the unique_titles table, we were able to get the titles of the employees based on their first occurrence of employee number.

## Summary

A total of 90,398 employees are about to retire and their roles need to filled.
There are plenty of retirement ready employees to mentor the next generation, however we seem to have too little eligible mentors to take their positions as shown below.
